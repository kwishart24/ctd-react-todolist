# My Todo List

My Todo List is a web app made with React and Vite for my Code the Dream React Class.

## Installation Instructions

1. Fork the repo in GitHub and save a copy of the repo to your own account using whatever name you'd like.

2. Clone the repo to your local machine by clicking the green "Code" button in your newly forked repo. And clicking copy to copy the URL or SSH link.

3. Open a command prompt window and navigate to the folder on your local machine where you'd like to clone the repo to.

4. Type into the command line "git clone {insert copied URL or SSH here}". And hit Enter. The repo will be cloned to your local machine. 


## How to Run the Development Server

1. Once the repo has finished installing, navigate to your new project repo by typing "cd {insert name of your repo}". Hit Enter.

2. In the command prompt, type "npm run dev" to run the development server.

3. Copy the URL where it says "Local" and paste into your web browser. Now your development server is running and you should be able to view your project in your web browser!
